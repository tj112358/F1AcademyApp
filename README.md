I don't like trying to navigate to the F1 Academy webiste for standings, news, etc, when I'm used to just having a nice mobile app for F1. I'm taking my first CS class, Advanced Topics in Program Languages, by Joe Burgireno, and making this as my self-guided project. Unfortunantly, I did not know what git was or how to commit to a git until a good month into the project. I have the linked google doc as a (very unprofessional) progress log, includinging linking to the resources I used to learn Swift basics. 

Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qrKXn8SsONdS8BWXUdm5Qavv7JGQWytzF_7s6QlZ0ZM/edit?usp=sharing
